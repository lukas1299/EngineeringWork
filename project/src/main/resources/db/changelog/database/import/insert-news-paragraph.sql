	 ('f1b031ef-3a9c-4478-ad0e-061e771d9fb6','Is the cockapoo a breed?','Cockapoo is a cross between two officially recognized breeds - poodle and cocker spaniel. However, it is not a race per se. Individual cockapoos may differ from each other both in size and appearance of the coat or even in character, which contradicts the definition of the breed as a group of individuals with a common origin and repetitive characteristics. The existence of the cockapoo is not recognized by any international canine organizations.It should be remembered that mating representatives of several breeds with each other is one of the ways in which new breeds of dogs are created. In this way, Czech terriers (a combination of a Scottish terrier and a Sealyham terrier), as well as Boston terriers (descendants of bulldogs and English terriers) and Dobermans (a mix of German pinscher with many other breeds) were bred in this way. Creating new breeds, however, requires careful selection of litter parents, rigorous selection of offspring showing only desirable characteristics and special care for the health of dogs. Therefore, before the cockapoo is recognized as a breed, breeders still have many years of careful work ahead of them.',1,'46346dac-f131-4208-9ecd-83da08a06e7b'),
	 ('7e41543c-cae8-468c-a439-a3143fe38d41','Cockapoo appearance and character','Cockapoos are usually small to medium-sized dogs with a friendly disposition, showing a willingness to cooperate with the guardian. However, both the appearance and character of a cockapoo dog can vary significantly depending on the genes that show up in him.Some individuals may weigh as little as 9 kg, others will grow to 20 kg. Some of them will have curly hair with a light color, others will inherit long hair and black color. Most cockapoos are active dogs that require long walks and interesting activities to stimulate the mind, although there are also typical couch dogs, reluctant to move and extremely stubborn. Poodle-spaniel crosses are usually friendly towards people and other dogs, but there are also cockapoos that are reactive, fearful and insecure around strangers.Cockapoos are considered excellent family dogs and good playmates for children. However, due to the large differences between individuals, the person buying a cockapoo puppy never knows what character the pooch will have when he grows up. Therefore, when deciding on a cockapoo, you should focus on careful socialization and habituation, which will reduce the risk of behavioral problems in your pet.',2,'46346dac-f131-4208-9ecd-83da08a06e7b'),
	 ('35442400-8d05-473f-af71-ab307a5652e4','The most common cockapoo diseases','It has been assumed that mongrels are usually much healthier than purebred dogs and this is partly true. Many hereditary diseases are conditioned by recessive genes that are perpetuated by artificial selection. Two ''sets'' of genes containing a disease-causing mutation are usually needed for such diseases to occur. Crossbreeding mixed dogs reduces the likelihood of such a combination, although it does not completely eliminate it.However, it should be remembered that the cockapoo is a cross between two breeds in which there are many mutations that determine genetic diseases. While poodles and cocker spaniels are at risk of developing eye problems, joint problems, diabetes and epilepsy, their mixed offspring are still at risk. The combination of the genes of two breeds also favors the development of additional diseases in the offspring, which have not previously occurred in the parents.It should also be remembered that many cockapoos are dogs from parents that only resemble poodles and spaniels, because you do not need a pedigree documenting the origin of the parents to cross them. Dogs bred outside international canine organizations do not have to undergo any health examinations. For this reason, people who decide to buy a cockapoo puppy should take special care of their pet''s health, regularly visit a veterinarian and carry out prophylactic examinations.',3,'46346dac-f131-4208-9ecd-83da08a06e7b'),
	 ('7b416b90-3928-41e4-a761-73483e8d2661','Pay attention to me','Winking is one of the ways a dog tries to attract the owner''s attention - as is staring at him with buttery eyes. It''s hard to resist such behavior, especially since it has a positive connotation. So it''s no wonder that dogs quickly learn that winking brings them so many benefits. After all, is there anything better than the interest of a loved one?',1,'45bbc940-5198-47e7-ac4b-b4fdf1bf1a27'),
	 ('986a2741-52b4-46d8-8ae5-1a002e8cc517','Imitation','Who you hang out with, that''s what you become - a saying that can also be applied to the dog-human relationship. Many people who study the behavior of dogs agree that pets resemble their owners. So if your dog winks at you and you also wink a lot at other people or even at the dog itself, you may suspect it of imitation. But let''s not confuse imitation with mocking. In this context, it is due to the dog''s positive feelings towards its owner.',2,'45bbc940-5198-47e7-ac4b-b4fdf1bf1a27'),
	 ('af2e3d51-814e-4df7-9644-e86e6eeb6f27','I give up','Interestingly, by blinking - actually winking - dogs can also show their submissiveness. This behavior most often takes place when interacting with kin. We can then notice that in such a situation the dog additionally curls up, puts his ears flat, and tucks his tail under himself. The purpose of this behavior? Mitigation or resolution of conflict between dogs. It also means that the dog feels uncomfortable in a particular situation.',3,'45bbc940-5198-47e7-ac4b-b4fdf1bf1a27'),
	 ('4b55be6e-0063-49d8-977e-dbf5fcf42ebb','Eyelid spasm','Sometimes a dog winks because he has blepharospasm. This is a fairly common condition that affects both dogs and humans. Cramp most often occurs when we are tired or stressed and lasts from a few seconds to several minutes.',4,'45bbc940-5198-47e7-ac4b-b4fdf1bf1a27'),
	 ('d70687ec-7306-4357-884a-262a2329e5ca','Harbinger of health problems','Although winking has a rather positive connotation, it can also be a harbinger of certain health problems. If you notice that your dog blinks unusually often, especially with one eye, it may mean that something is wrong. Frequent blinking is a reaction to pain or sensitivity to light. It can also mean discomfort that is associated with an eye infection. A dog - just like a human - reacts to various irritating factors, such as dust or dirt. If your pet blinks for too long and often, contact your veterinarian.The reason for a visit to the veterinary office is also a reddened eye or its vicinity, disturbing discharge, tearing or cloudiness, etc. It may turn out that the dog suffers from allergies, and even suffers from, for example, entropion, i.e. the eyelid rolls up towards the eyeball. Another affliction affecting dogs is ectropion - a disease in which the eyelid curls outward from the eye.However, if there are no disturbing signs of eye irritation, and the dog blinks occasionally, there is no reason to worry. It is worth paying attention to the situations in which the dog ''winks at us''. Perhaps this is how he shows us his feelings!',5,'45bbc940-5198-47e7-ac4b-b4fdf1bf1a27'),
	 ('8ea11c8a-47a8-4424-b403-70ea3a6e9ead','Why does a dog actually wag its tail?','There are many indications that researchers from Stuttgart have found the answer to a question that has been bothering many people for years - especially dog lovers. Scientists from the team of Dr. Ardian Yusufi from the Institute of Intelligent Systems Max Planck built a mathematical model describing the movement of the dog. They took a closer look at what happens to the dog''s body when it jumps. They carefully examined its movements, turns, paws and tail. It has been proven that when jumping, the movement of the tail has almost no effect on the trajectory of the jump. The result could be an amazing breakthrough in understanding the behavior and functioning of the dog''s body.',1,'e079e7bf-8720-4bdd-ae1f-950ee54275eb'),
	 ('2a8bdf4b-f3ff-4c4d-855f-ad34af7bb6b3','What does a dog communicate through its tail?','The study''s findings are published on biorxiv.org. In addition to presenting evidence of little interference from the tail in jumping, the researchers also determined that this part of the body is primarily used by dogs for communication.By observing a dog''s tail, we can recognize a pet''s emotions. Many a dog''s guardian noticed the pet''s wagging tail when returning home, and when his ward was scared - the tail disappeared and cleverly tucked under the dog''s body.',2,'e079e7bf-8720-4bdd-ae1f-950ee54275eb');
